🛒 E-commerce Customer & Sales Insights Analysis
**End-to-End Data Analysis Project on 15,000+ Transactions**

📌 Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive data analysis of an e-commerce dataset containing over **15,000 transactions**. The goal was to bridge the gap between raw sales data and customer demographics to provide actionable insights into consumer behavior.

🛠️ Tech Stack Used
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib): For Data Cleaning, Merging, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- MySQL: For structured data storage and performing complex relational queries (Joins & Aggregations).
- Power BI: For building an interactive business dashboard with dynamic KPIs.

 📂 Repository Structure
- 01_Data/: Contains raw and processed CSV files.
- 02_Python_Analysis/:  Python scripts for data processing.
- 03_SQL_Queries/: SQL scripts for database analysis.
- 04_PowerBI_Dashboard/: Interactive .pbix file and dashboard screenshots.
- 05_Visualizations/: Static plots generated during initial Python analysis.
  
 📈 Key Insights from Analysis
- Top Product Performance: Identified the top 10 products contributing to the highest sales volume.
- Demographic Segmentation: Analyzed shopping patterns based on **Gender** and **Age Groups** (as seen in the Power BI dashboard).
- Sales Trends: Visualized daily sales patterns to identify peak shopping periods and optimize inventory.

🚀 Future Roadmap
- Automation with n8n: Integrating n8n to automate the data pipeline from CSV to MySQL.
- Advanced DAX: Adding more complex business logic and measures in Power BI.
